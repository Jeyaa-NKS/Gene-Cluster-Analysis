# Gene-Cluster-Analysis

### Objective: 
The objective of this project was to perform gene expression analysis for the classification of cancer types using DNA microarray data. The dataset used in this analysis contains measurements of ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) and AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) samples from Bone Marrow and Peripheral Blood.

## Data Preprocessing

Data Loading: The project began with loading the gene expression data from the provided dataset files, including the training and test datasets, as well as the actual labels.

Data Cleaning: Data cleaning involved checking for missing values, handling object features, and extracting numerical features. The datasets were merged and split into training and test sets.

Feature Scaling: Standardization (scaling) of the features was performed to ensure that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
